# Infrastructure

## Hardware

### Hard drives

If possible, make sure to have 4 hard drives installed on the workstation for:

* Operating System
* System Backup
* Media
* Media Backup

:::tip
Backing up your system and media data is more important because compared with hard drive cost, the time spent on recovering OS or data is much more expensive.

## Workstation OS

Here are some OS options to consider:

|                             OS                              |                Pros                |            Cons            |
| :---------------------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------: | :------------------------: |
| Linux Mint [[download](https://linuxmint.com/download.php)] |               Stable               |       Slower updates       |
|  Ubuntu [[download](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)]   | Faster update and larger ecosystem |      Things can break      |
|       Pop!_OS [[download](https://pop.system76.com/)]       |  Good for gaming and engineering   | No grub, hard to dual boot |

:::tip
I personally use **Linux Mint** because I value stability over other factors.
